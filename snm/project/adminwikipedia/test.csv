Boing! said Zebedee,BDD,1,1,"'''Support'''. I can understand opposers who want to see more content work, but I don't accept that admins are a ""governing class"". Or at least, we're not supposed to be - we're supposed to be a serving class. I know there are some admins who think they're the bosses, and I've clashed with one or two of them in my time. But I do think that those who are best at creating content should create content and those who can serve best by protecting and assisting them in that task should become admins (though I would like to see more overlap in the two roles). So when evaluating candidates at RfA, my final decision to some extent comes down to whether I think they have a ""serving"" or a ""ruling"" mentality - and I think BDD fits in the former category quite easily. --",4/20/2013 18:47,2013,3227,5957,161,263,137,5,144

As much as I respect Malleus, S Marshall and Colonel Warden for their content creation efforts, and Jusdafax for his usually sound reasoning, I must say that I believe that these four gentlemen are singing a tad off-key in this instance.

Wikipedia is, after all, an encyclopedia, and our principal purpose is to create good content; that purpose includes all users, including admins.  That having been said, I think BDD has demonstrated he knows how to write well enough in the English vernacular, and how to create an encyclopedia article based on a dozen or more among the 38 articles he has created.

WP exists in a state where compromise is essential and no one solution is perfect, having content led administrators would be good for many things but not everything, so when good candidates come forward who will be a net positive to the project, even if they don't have a FA, GA, DYK and the triple crown, I feel we should support them and make use of the skills they offer the community.",4/23/2013 22:12,2013,600,5957,0,158,137,5,151

I see plenty of evidence that the candidate listens thoughtfully to feedback and is ready to self-correct, and I see ''enough'' experience with content.

Salvidrim,BDD,1,1,"'''Support''' - The encounters I've had with BDD have always left me with a feeling that the editor was a competent and greatly useful contributor. I have no worries that he will continue helping to improve Wikipedia with his new tools. I want to note, again, that I find ""lack of content creation"" to be a very poor reason to oppose. Wikipedia needs content contributors. Wikipedia needs editors interested in discussions and dispute resolution. Wikipedia needs gnomish editors. Wikipedia needs administrators. Some users are lucky enough to be part of more than one of those categories. Requiring RfA candidates to be content-oriented, discussion-oriented and maintenance-oriented all at once is really fucking stupid and it's the reason why hardly anybody wants to volunteer for an RfA, and even less make it through. Y'all need to [[WP:NBD|chill out]] and let people who want to help [[WP:NETPOS|actually do so]], as long as they're not grievously inexperienced or have shown poor behaviour or judgement. Granted, if the process for revoking adminship wasn't so cumbersome, perhaps it would help, but that's another debate altogether. <span style=""13px Sylfaen;color:white;background-color:#000000;padding:0 3px 0 3px;"">''':)'''&nbsp;·",4/26/2013 1:03,2013,11018,5957,0,7,137,5,185

And, as the candidate is quite proficient with redirects, it's surprising that he didn't go on to create redirects for the distinctive brewery names like [[Laughing Dog Brewery]].  As the candidate is a librarian, I would have expected them to do a better job by turning up sources like ''Beer and Brewing in the Inland Northwest, 1850 to 1950'' or ''Great American Craft Beer''.

Colonel Warden,Bilby,-1,1,"'''Oppose''' When I checked his contributions, I noticed a particular interest in [[Ugg boots]].  This reminded me of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sheepskin boots]], in which  the candidate seemed to prefer that we address the topic in a proprietary way, rather than a generic one.  This does not seem sufficiently neutral and so I am concerned that he might use admin tools in a partisan way.  It may well be that he is very sensible in other respects but as I am most familiar with that particular incident, I'll put the boot in :).",5/26/2013 8:15,2013,4669,9228,0,98,137,11,92
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liangshan Yi,Bilby,-1,1,"'''Oppose''' Bilby seems to be a very fine candidate in most respects. But Warden has highlighted a problem. On the [[Ugg boots trademark disputes]] article, there has been a series of Requests For Comment. The first one was closed improperly by an Australian problem editor who has been involved in repeated misconduct. The second one has an obvious meatpuppet case by another Australian editor described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADpmuk&diff=555224192&oldid=555093685 here], and another possible case that is more subtle and much more damaging to Wikipedia described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUgg_boots_trademark_disputes&diff=553967503&oldid=553963004 here], also possibly involving several Australian editors. As I have said on the Talk page, it looks good but it smells bad. I think Bilby is a fine editor. He is the best Australian editor involved in that series of articles. But when the trouble started, he disappeared. Bilby has done nothing to counsel the problem editors from Australia and improve their behavior. Instead he has become their ally whenever they needed one. Therefore I am concerned that we are giving administrative powers to one side in a content dispute. I am also concerned that the first RFC was closed improperly, and the second may be closed improperly in a very similar way. Consensus should be determined by [[WP:CONSENSUS#Determining_consensus]]: ""Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy."" The number of votes is not mentioned and should not matter. Also, in [[Wikipedia:Closing_discussions]]: ""Consensus is not determined by counting heads."" But the first RFC was closed by the Australian problem editor, by counting votes and ignoring policy arguments. The second time it was closed, the administrator admitted that one side had stronger policy arguments, but he allowed the larger number of votes on the other side to balance it, producing a ""no consensus"" result. This RFC needs greater participation by experienced editors who will rely on policy, not the number of votes. Bilby has voted on the side that has more votes and no policy arguments. Then he disappeared. This raises doubts about how he would use administrative tools if they are given to him. I regret I must oppose this nomination.",5/28/2013 13:52,2013,10884,9228,0,1,137,11,360

I am regretful because from a quick look at the quality of the copyvio work I thought that Darkwind would have been a useful addition to the admin corps.

On Q5, this very vanilla answer gives no assurance that the candidate would not create more problems by blocking for minor breaches of civility. I needed to see some understanding of just what a delicate and nuanced area civility has become in recent years and this wasn't apparent in the answer. As Dennis says, there is little to no interaction in user talk to judge the candidate's people skills on either.

The nominator calls Darkwind one of his or her four ""friends"" on their user page and I consider that a bit conflicting. Take all the advice from this RfA and come back in 6 months.

Bishonen,Darkwind,-1,1,"'''Oppose.''' I'm sorry, I know question 5 (civility enforcement) is very difficult and there certainly isn't one ""correct"" answer. But I'm not happy to see such a carefree, almost jaunty reply to it. Are you aware that, precisely, the question of what civility/incivility and egregious personal attacks ''are'' is tearing the community and the admin corps apart? (Your answer to Q 14, while fuller, doesn't exactly suggest such an awareness either.) You may be the only person I've ever seen using the phrase ""clearly defined"" in this area. I wouldn't oppose you for having opposite opinions on civility enforcement to my own, but I really think I must oppose somebody who doesn't appear to see the problems. Sorry. I'll be prepared to reconsider if you revise your answer a bit, or perhaps rather add to it, because it's not so much what you say as what you don't say. Adminship may not be a big deal, but it's not something to enter without having thought some about this, the most difficult, part of the job and showing some awareness of the inherent problems, and being willing to discuss them in a somewhat analytical and personal way. For instance, ""preventative not punitive"" is a very pious ideal, but what exactly does it mean? It's very easy to game. Many blocks are in my opinion obviously punitive (if you don't agree, please say so), but get defended as being intended to deter (=prevent) others from committing the same offence. If this is the actual situation, might it be better to rephrase the good old wikisaying as ""blocks are not for revenge, but for prevention and for defining the limits of behaviour on Wikipedia"" or something like that? That's just a thought, one example, I don't necessarily expect you to address that particular one. But I'd just like to see a little more depth in this answer, and more of your own personal opinions, too.

Boing! said Zebedee,Darkwind,-1,1,"Regretful '''Oppose''', for a couple of reasons. I think gnome work is great, and in many ways gnomes are the unsung heroes of Wikipedia. But I think a suitable admin candidate needs to be able to demonstrate reasonably extensive interaction with other editors, with some experience of disputes or other problematic areas, so that we can get some idea of how they will handle interactions under pressure. Admin actions will get you into disputes, sometimes quite fraught ones, and getting the tone of interaction with others right can be very difficult - I have lots of experience of it, and I still get it wrong sometimes. Also, as others have suggested, I don't think I see a proper appreciation of the complexity of civility - it's something that has divided the community for some time, and it really is a lot more difficult than ""talk nice or face action"". I'd suggest getting involved in dispute resolution for a while. For example, look for newcomers having problems and try to help them out - there are plenty of places you can find disputes to help with. I look forward to being able to support a future admin run when I can see something of how you handle interaction and dispute. --",12/28/2012 13:42,2013,3227,7949,161,263,146,2,210

The candidate's responses to civility issues were shallow, but that squares with me as normal given no experience in contentious areas. And there is major lack of experience in content creation or building. I would not want to hand over the block button to the candidate under those circumstances unless either it was clear he was definitely not interested in going into areas like ANI and DELETION.

[I'm not trying to open a thread here about why we don't separate the tools, but I am puzzled why WP hasn't made that logical move yet, and prefers to have these endless debates based on the same illogical point that 1) the Admin package includes all the tools, 2) an Admin candidate needs to be trusted in all the areas those tools apply, 3) it isn't realistic to expect a candidate to demonstrate trusted experience/knowledge in all those areas, and 4) that the candidate should re-apply to RfA after spending time boosting his experience/knowledge in those areas [even though the candidate may not have any interest in those areas -- which is like making someone eat ""peas"" when they may not like them].

Lack of dispute or conflict is likely due to this sort of one-off edits. It concerns me that he wants tools but doesn't want to specifically stay within a specific realm, but roam around with admin tools. I might be more inclined if he specifically stuck to one area and showed a depth of experience in that area; or conversely, if the desire is to roam, then he needs more experience in other areas to support his use of tools in these other areas.",12/31/2012 18:07,2013,6307,7949,0,32,146,2,180

Tryptofish,INeverCry,1,1,"'''Support'''. I have to admit that I think there are too many questions for candidates at RfA, and I generally do not like asking them. I asked Q12 this time because I saw a request for such a question on the RfA talk page, and it struck me as a reasonable request. But the question I asked is a sufficiently tricky one that it can lend itself to being a ""gotcha"", which is something I generally disapprove of in RfA. All of that is a long way of getting around to saying that, for me, this RfA comes down to evaluating whether I trust a candidate who has a strong track record at Commons to understand how to deal with ''content'', rather than files, here. I'm entirely satisfied. Q12 deals with a situation that actually comes up rather regularly at [[WP:FFD]], pitting a nominator who is a stickler for limiting the use of non-free files (not permitted at Commons, and an important difference between there and here) against a content editor who sees the value of the particular image for the particular content. I don't want admins doing file work who fail to listen to the content editors. The cautious answer, along with the honest admissions elsewhere in the RfA of mistakes from which the candidate has learned, tell me that this is someone who is going to be careful to do no harm. Although a lot of the editing history here has been gnomish edits and work on list pages, I looked carefully at the editing history of [[George Crabbe]], and I find clear evidence of actual sourcing and content work. Taking that all together, I'm fully comfortable that this is someone who can work administratively with image files while understanding what goes into serious content creation. --",2/2/2013 16:37,2013,11214,8299,0,171,110,23,299

Now it's making a comeback as ""being bored is not a good reason for wanting the tools"" but it seems obvious to me that this is JQ's way of saying ""I'd like to explore other ways of helping out"". I would suggest that everyone who's worked on Wikipedia for more than two or three years (and that includes many of the opposes below) knows that feeling. You join Wikipedia to work on articles about 19th-century entomologists, you get a little jaded and you start coordinating WikiProject Insects. That slowly becomes less interesting so you switch gears and start doing some anti-vandalism work but that's only interesting and challenging for a few months and you decide that your time would be better spent in improving Wikipedia's coverage of Tanzanian culture. I suspect that ""I'm kinda bored and am looking for new challenges"" is actually a very typical motivation in RfA candidates.

My evidence for this was that the user said they would like to edit protected pages. At first I thought this meant so they could edit without using {{tl|editprotected}}, basically for convenience.

Experience is, so I will see if I can cancel this worry. 3.In question 13 you did not answer it fully which is explaining when page protection should not be used, again joined to concern ''2''.

Nsk92,Jason Quinn,0,1,"'''Neutral'''. I would have much liked to support, particularly a fellow mathematician. The candidate is certainly experienced and trustworthy and has made significant contributions to the project. I don't think that any RfA candidate has to demonstrate any kind of a ""need"" for the tools. However, Mephistophelian raises valid concerns and I find the candidate's response at this RFA's talk page troubling rather than reassuring. I do not believe that any adminship candidate needs to necessarily have any FA,GA or DYK  articles in their record.  Different people contribute to the project in different ways, and, for example, concentrating on gnomish work is perfectly fine. But I do think that any experienced user, and most certainly any admin candidate, needs to make sure that the new content they do create is taken to some basic level of acceptability, at the very least to the level of a respectable stub. By that I mean a stub where at least the main basic facts are expressly referenced to [[WP:RS]] and notability of the topic is made apparent to a casual passer-by. After that is done, it is perfectly fine to leave the article in peace and let other users work on expanding it.  But creating completely unsourced stubs and leaving them in the mainspace as easy targets for PRODding/AfDing or at least for getting slapped with ugly maintenance tags is not OK. In this case the candidate has created quite a few stubs that I would consider sub-par and below the standard of being a minimally respectable stub. E.g. the articles [[Crotaphion]], [[Apoquindo Waterfall]], [[Andreas Airfield]], [[Wildlife of Chile]], [[Salar de Pedernales]] and [[Sharp map]] remain completely unsourced even now (and even after concerns about them have been raised in this RfA). The [[Crotaphion]] article was created in April 2012, not 7-8 years ago (when    unsourced articles were viewed as more acceptable).",1/28/2013 13:32,2013,3351,878,0,117,196,0,309

He requested EFM because he wanted to help monitor AbuseFilter bugs and false positives on private filters. He requested sysop on Wikidata because he was finding a lot of duplicates needing deletion, and was later nominated for 'crat after establishing himself as one of our best users, including working heavily on bot policy. If we could replace all of our admins, good or bad, with <code title={{NUMBEROFADMINS}}><nowiki>{{NUMBEROFADMINS}}</nowiki></code> Legoktms, I'd happily support it. I've found that sometimes, somehow, certain admins manage to be bold whenever moderation is called for, and unnecessarily bureaucratic when decisive action is needed. Legoktm is the opposite of this: He knows exactly when to go with his gut, and when to seek broader input. If anyone else said at RFA that they hadn't really been in any conflicts, I'd call bullshit.

Ryan Postlethwaite,Lord Roem,1,1,"'''Support''' - Appears to be a firm candidate. After reading through the opposition, I'm unconvinced that this will make him a ''bad'' administrator.

Érico Júnior Wouters,Lord Roem,1,1,"'''Weak support''' I really consider the number of deleted edits important in RfAs. And I think 73 (1.05% of total edits) deleted edits are not very appropriate for showing if know or not the deletion policy, to me. So It's a ""weak support"".",1/24/2013 1:15,2013,152,9673,0,16,221,60,43

Guy Macon,Lord Roem,1,1,"'''Strong support''' I wish we had 20 more like him. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] EDIT: after carefully reading the oppose arguments, I still support. Should this pass, I suggest that they wait a year, review his work as an admin, and give an ""I was right"" or ""I was wrong"" opinion.
